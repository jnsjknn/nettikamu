## Why

To help people meet new people and make friends without having to deal with scammers, spammer bots or unwanted sexual attention.

## How

Although similar websites already exist, they seem to be filled with misbehaving people and removing their content doesn't prevent them from posting again. By only allowing logged in users post and requiring SMS verification, misbehaving user's can be blocked.

## What

- Users can create posts with a short introduction about themselves and share their messaging app usernames
- Users can view all posts created by other users and contact anyone they want
- To view messaging app usernames, user must be logged in which allows moderation.
